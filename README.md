## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the shape detection project, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- NumPy

You can install these prerequisites using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy


Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shape-detection.git
cd shape-detection

Run the shape detection script:
python detect_shapes.py

Usage
Provide an image file that contains the shapes you want to detect.

Run the detect_shapes.py script, and it will analyze the image, detect shapes, and display the results.

Optionally, you can customize the detection parameters and output format by modifying the script's code.
